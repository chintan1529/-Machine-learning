Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains various machine learning projects implemented in Python. The projects demonstrate the use of basic machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression. Each project is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the algorithm, the dataset used, and the results.

Projects Overview
1. Naive Bayes Classifier
Description: This project implements the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification tasks. It is used to classify data based on probability and Bayes' Theorem.
Dataset: The dataset used for this project is [Dataset Name] (e.g., Iris Dataset, Spam Email Dataset).
Key Concepts:
Probability theory
Bayes' Theorem
Conditional independence
Results: The model is able to predict classes with an accuracy of X% (insert result here).
2. Linear Regression
Description: This project implements the Linear Regression algorithm to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
Dataset: The dataset used for this project is [Dataset Name] (e.g., Boston Housing Dataset).
Key Concepts:
Linear relationships
Least squares method
Coefficient estimation
Results: The model achieves an R-squared value of X% (insert result here).
3. Logistic Regression
Description: This project demonstrates the Logistic Regression algorithm used for binary classification problems. It predicts the probability of the target variable belonging to a certain class.
Dataset: The dataset used for this project is [Dataset Name] (e.g., Titanic Dataset, Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset).
Key Concepts:
Sigmoid function
Log odds
Binary classification
Results: The model's accuracy is X% (insert result here).
